        <div class="child">This story is from the Kojiki, the Japanese "Record of Ancient Things"</div>
        <div class="child">
            Izanagi and Izanami were commanded by the first five deities to solidify and create the land of Japan.<br>
            The deities gave the young pair a jeweled spear. Standing on the Floating Bridge of Heaven, they dipped it in the ocean brine and stirred. They pulled out the spear, and the brine that dripped of it formed an island to which they descended. On this island they built a palace for their wedding and a great column to the heavens.<br>
            They mated and created Japan's eight main islands and six minor islands. They then gave birth to a number of deities to inhabit those islands, including the sea deity, the sea-strait deity, and the deities of rivers, winds, trees, and mountains. Last, Izanami gave birth to the fire deity, which she passed away after giving birth.<br>
            Izanagi griefs and goes to the underworld to find Izanami. He asked to come back to the land of the living with him. But she refused and enraged, she said that she will strangle 1000 people a day. Then Izanagi said he will give birth to 1500 people a day. That's why fifteen hundred children are born each day and one thousand people die each day
        </div>
        <div class="child">With all of the answers to the questions people may have, like why do people die, and why are they born, who created the islands, and more, I think the deeper meaning of this story is to have an easy, believable story which people can share to ensure the people who ask the questions, get an answer and have a discrete answer, rather than multiple answers from different people</div>
        <div class="child">This story tries to explain how the land of Japan was created and tells how the deities control the land, why people are born and die, and is passed on generations, because of those answers to the questions people have</div>

    <!-- Yahweh -->
    <div class="grid-region">
        <div class="region-title catamaran center">Yahweh</div>
        <div class="region-title-image"><img src="Yahweh.jpg" class="titleImage"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="parent">
        <div class="child">This creation story is from Genesis 2:4 to 3:24 of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament)</div>

        <div class="child">One day, Yahweh created the heavens and the earth, took dust from the ground and created a man, created a garden called Eden.<br>Decided that the man should not be alone and that he should have a helper, Yahweh created the beasts of the field and the birds of the air, and the man gave each of them a name.<br>However, none of the men were fit to be his helpers, so Yahweh put the man to sleep and removed one of his ribs, transforming it into a woman.<br>A snake in the garden persuaded the woman that she might eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil without dying, and she gave some of the fruit to the man as well.<br>They were ashamed of being naked for the first time, so they made aprons for themselves.<br>When they heard Yahweh, they hid from him.<br>When he asked why they were hiding, they said they were ashamed of what they were wearing.<br>Yahweh said to the snake, "Because of what you have done, you are cursed more than any other animal.‚Äù</div>

        <div class="child">Because they both ate the apple of good and evil, I believe the deeper meaning of this story is that people will always be self-conscious about what they have</div>

        <div class="child">This story tries to explain how animals and humans were created, as well as why people are self-conscious about the things they have (because others may have better things), rather than being content with what they have. I suppose that is why it has lasted through the ages</div>
